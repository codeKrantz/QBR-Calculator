This was an assinment for my Computer Programming II class.
The instructions were to use information from a CSV file to create a New CSV file that has all the original information
along with a QBR calculation for each player and a descriptor of that number as a string.

When the program is run nothing will happen in the console because the programe writes a new file, so if check your files to see if a file called results 
is created.
